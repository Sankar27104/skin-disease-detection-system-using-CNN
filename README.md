# Skin Disease Detection System using CNN

A deep learning-based project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify skin diseases from images. The goal of the system is to assist in early and accurate diagnosis of common skin conditions.

## 🚀 Features

- Trained CNN model for image classification.
- Efficient image preprocessing and augmentation.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.
- Capable of classifying multiple types of skin conditions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
